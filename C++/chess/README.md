White pieces are represented by lowercase letters ('p'), black pieces by uppercase letters ('P').

Moves are entered in the format: `starting_position` `target_position` ("e2 e4").

Once the player enters correct positions, the game makes the move, displays the current chessboard, and passes the turn to the opponent.
If incorrect positions are entered, the player will be prompted to re-enter the positions.

If the player enters `save` instead of a move, they will be prompted to enter a filename, e.g., `game1.txt`. The program saves the game as `game1.txt` in the `examples/` directory.

After the game ends, the result will be displayed: `WHITE WINS`, `BLACK WINS`, `TIE`, or `STALEMATE`.
